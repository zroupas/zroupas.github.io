Welcome to my Blog! I’m not sure how you got here but I’m glad you did!

In this Blog i will try to gather every bit of knowledge,information and configuration that i found around the web and tailored so as to feet my needs in order to keep it in one place. **And this is going to be a big challenge knowing me!**

You can also find some basic information about me [here]

I'm going to close this first post by adding a computer geek joke:

_A programmer’s wife tells him, “While you’re at the grocery store, buy some eggs.” He never comes back!_

Stay tuned..
